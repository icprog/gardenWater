Solenoid valve control to water the garden.

###What is this?

This project is for the lazy men in you, it will simply use an Adafruit HUZZAH to drive two water valves to control the watering of the backyard garden and tomatoes plants. It will be controlled from a web page using the aREST API for the ESP8266.

Web page will probably be hosted on a RaspberryPi2 I already have running for other stuff.

###Hardware
- Adafruit HUZZAH
- 2x Solenoid water 1/2" valves

###Libraries used
- aREST

###IDE
